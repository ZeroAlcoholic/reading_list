\section{What I have read.}

In order to recognize physical/human activity, I explored the previous work about how to use wearable and non-wearable device to detect physical/human activity \cite{Muro-de-la-Herran:2014, He:2013, LingBao:2004}.There was widespread application for physical activity, so I also read the  paper about how to analyze gait or posture \cite{Seel:2014, Hung:2013, Benocci:2009} , how to use it in the field of rehabilitation \cite{Chen:2015}, how to analyze the movement's quality \cite{Kikhia:2014, Mentis:2013} and how to give the sensory feedback \cite{Christian:2011, Christian:2012}.
