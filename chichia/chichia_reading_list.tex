\section{Project: Chatmood}
For the last project, \textbf{Chatmood}, I explored the previous work about conveying emotion with emoticons\cite{Sanchez:CLIHC05,Sanchez:IHC06} or other aids\cite{Yeo:CHIEA08, Tsetserukou:LNCS09} in online text chatting. The purpose of \textbf{Chatmood} is to motivate social network site users to label their emotions during online text chatting, I also read papers for affective labeling \cite{Broekens:ACII09} and research about gathering emotion tags from twitter \cite{Pak:LREC10, Wu:AAAI15}. On the other hand, I claim that the label collected with \textbf{Chatmood} is context dependent, so, I need to compare it with other context dependent corpus \cite{Boia:AAAI14}.

\section{Project: Sports}
The purpose of this project is not  decided yet. I can only say that it is about sports \cite{Jensen:CHI15, Knaving:CHI15, Kosmalla:CHI15, Mueller:CHI15}.
